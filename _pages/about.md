Hello, welcome to my homepage!

I'm currently an Engineering Biology MSc(R) student at the University of Bristol working under the supervision of Professor Thomas Gorochowski.

My master's research focused on applying open-ended design principles to genetic circuit design in E. coli. I'm interested in how we can engineer biological systems with evolution in mind. 

I will be finishing my master's in spring 2026 and I am interested in continuing to explore the field of Engineering Biology through further study or working in industry.

# Experience

I have a broad base of experience relevant to Engineering Biology.

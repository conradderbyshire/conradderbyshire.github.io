Hello, welcome to my homepage!

I'm currently an Engineering Biology MSc(R) student at the University of Bristol working under the supervision of Professor Thomas Gorochowski.

My master's research focused on applying open-ended design principles to genetic circuit design in E. coli. I'm interested in how we can engineer biological systems with evolution in mind. 

I will be finishing my master's in spring 2026 and I am interested in continuing to explore the field of Engineering Biology through further study or working in industry.

# Experience

I have a broad base of research experience which I will provide an overview of here. For further details, check out my CV! 

## MSc by Research at the University of Bristol

My master’s project has given me a solid foundation in the field of Engineering Biology. My research project is titled ‘Exploring the phenotypic space of genetic circuits using pooled combinatorial DNA assembly’. During this project, I have built significantly upon my existing laboratory experience from my undergraduate research placement (see below), performing high-throughput plate reader and flow cytometry screening and Nanopore sequencing for characterising libraries of genetic circuits. Additionally, I designed genetic parts, performed Golden Gate and Gibson assembly, and regularly used a variety of molecular biology techniques. However, I have also focused on developing my computational skills. This included learning Python and applying this skill for biological modelling, unsupervised machine learning, and extensive data analysis as part of my research project. Programming is a skill which I really enjoy and I am keen to further build on these skills during my PhD. It is exciting to see how computational methods are playing an ever more important role in scientific research. 

## Sainsbury Laboratory Cambridge University 10-week Placement 

In 2022, I completed a 10-week summer research placement at the prestigious Sainsbury Laboratory Cambridge University (SLCU) under the supervision of Dr Edwige Moyroud - a Natural Sciences fellow at University of Cambridge and research group leader at the SLCU. Here, I helped research the molecular mechanisms underlying plant petal patterning. My research project was titled ‘GABA - a signal for petal patterning in the model species Hibiscus tri-
onum’. The primary goal of my project was to produce knockout lines for key genes in the GABA pathway using CRISPR/Cas9 to investigate their role in petal pre-patterning. I was extremely fortunate to gain experience in a wide range of fundamental molecular biology techniques, including cloning, PCR and qPCR, plant transformation, CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing, and microscopy. Moreover, I got to present my research at the Summer Student Science Day, and the data produced from this research project is currently contributing towards a manuscript for which I will be a co-author.

## Conferences 

During my master’s, I attended the SynbiTECH 2024 conference where I got the opportunity to hear about lots of exciting advancements in the commercial Engineering Biology space. I was engaged by inspiring talks from various Engineering Biology companies and to speak to a range of interesting attendees, from those involved in start-up incubators to patent attorneys and CEOs.
